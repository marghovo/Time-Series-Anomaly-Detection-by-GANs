# Time-Series-Anomaly-Detection-by-GANs
Time Series Analysis and Anomaly Detection has always been at the center of active discussion in both academia and business. The areas of the applications of Time Series Anomaly Detection are numerous starting from monitoring systems and ending with stock market analysis. The main purpose of the paper is to describe how GANs, a novel deep learning algorithm, can be used to tackle the problem of Time Series Anomaly Detection.
